# Trans-Names
Tool for helping trans people find a good name for themselves
Essentially what this is a little bit of code for trans/enby/questioning/anyone who wants to change their name to test it out and see it and hear it in different ways.
I am using Google Text To Speech API (gTTS) so you you will need to install that.
Also I am running this on macOS Catalina so I am not sure how well it will translate or if it will work at all on other versions or operating systems\
Specifically it is calling the native afplay to mac however with some slight modification that could work on linux if you replace afplay with mpg123
